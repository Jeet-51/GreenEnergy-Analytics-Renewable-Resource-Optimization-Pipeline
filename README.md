## üéØ The Challenge

Renewable energy generation is inherently variable and dependent on complex environmental factors. To effectively manage and plan for grid stability, it's crucial to process massive datasets from geographically dispersed sources. Key challenges included:

* **Data Volume and Velocity:** Ingesting and processing terabytes of sensor, weather, and generation data from over 200 renewable energy sites.
* **Data Variety:** Handling unstructured data from various weather APIs alongside structured time-series data from generation sites.
* **Forecasting Accuracy:** The need for highly accurate energy production forecasts to ensure reliable grid management and resource allocation.
* **Data Integration:** Merging real-time operational data with historical data for comprehensive, long-term analysis.
